CompUServ User Repository

My Code Louisville C#/ASP.net project. This is a web app that allows a user to enter their name and email address into a repository for the fictional company CompUServ. Users can edit and delete their info at their whim. 

In order for this project to work you'll need to have Microsoft Visual Studio installed. Load the Index.cshtml file(UserInfo/Views/Table_1/Index.cshtml) in Visual Studio and at the second row at the top of the window click on "Google Chrome" or whatever you're prefered web browser is to run the project. This will brign up the home page of the app where you can enter your user name and email address.
