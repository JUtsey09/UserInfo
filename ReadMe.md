CompUServ User Repository

Requirements: 
Visual Studio: https://www.visualstudio.com/ 


My Code Louisville C#/ASP.net project. This is a web app that allows a user to enter their name and email address into a repository for the fictional company "CompUServ". Users can edit and delete their info at their own leisure. 

In order for this project to work you'll need to have Microsoft Visual Studio installed. Open the project in Visual Studio by clicking file, open,then project. Select the project file "UserInfo" from whatever folder you saved it in. On the toolbar in Visual Studio click on "Firefox" or whatever you're prefered web browser is to run the project. This will bring up the home page of the app where you can enter a user name and email address. The project uses LocalDB so you will not need to create a separate SQL database. 

**Responsive Design sometimes does not function properly when using Google Chrome. I don't know why this is however I tested it out in Firefox and Edge with no problems. If anyone experiences issues in Chrome simply use another browser and it should work just fine.**

Enjoy!
